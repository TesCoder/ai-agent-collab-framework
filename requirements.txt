# This repo intentionally uses Python stdlib only (no third-party pip dependencies).
#
# Operational requirement (to run the multi-agent workflow as intended):
# - An LLM chat/prompt interface that supports system prompts (e.g. Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
#
# Local tooling requirement:
# - Python 3.x (stdlib only)
