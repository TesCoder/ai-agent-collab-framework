# Temp changes tracker (Agent 0)

Purpose:
- Append-only log for **Agent 0** recommendations, handoffs, and diagnostics outputs that are intended to enable downstream work.

Rules:
- **Append-only**: add new entries only at end-of-file.
- Prefer timestamped entries (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS TZ) when possible.
- Keep entries concise and action-oriented (what / where / why / owner).

<!-- Entries go below. Keep this file append-only. -->
