Escalation triggers (template)

Escalate to the human owner when you see:
- Repeated missing evidence (“ghost work”)
- Repeated scope violations (editing forbidden files / unapproved directories)
- Conflicting instructions across agents
- Environment/tooling failures that block execution across commands

Escalation should include:
- the exact error / evidence missing
- the impacted Work Packet title + timestamp
- the smallest decision needed to unblock
